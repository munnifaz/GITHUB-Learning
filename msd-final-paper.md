## 1. Introduction üìñ
The ongoing increase in the complexity of IT development projects has elevated the importance of testing as a critical component of project success. This paper examines the organisation of the testing process and its profound impact on IT project management. The examination of methodologies, challenges and best practices.

This paper examines a range of testing methodologies, risk analysis techniques and practices, including test design and defect lifecycle management. Furthermore, the paper analyses the testing landscape in contemporary IT environments, with particular reference to agile and hybrid development models.

### Motivation üí°
Modern IT projects are characterised by high complexity and quality requirements, which makes testing an integral part of their successful execution. An efficiently organised testing process plays a key role in preventing defects, minimising costs and ensuring end-user satisfaction. Meanwhile, the growing adoption of agile methodologies such as Agile and DevOps emphasises the need to adapt testing to new project management approaches.

At every stage of software development, from design to deployment, testing fulfils the functions of defect detection and prevention. According to research, it can be 100 times more expensive to fix bugs found late in development than in the early stages (Burnstein, 2006). This feature emphasises the importance of integrating testing into core project management processes to reduce the risk of critical bugs.

In addition, the transition to CI/CD models requires the implementation of continuous testing to meet the requirements for frequent releases. Test automation becomes a critical tool to ensure speed and reliability, as noted by Dustin et al. (1999).
### Problem Statement ‚ùì
#### Relevance of the research
Insufficient organisation of testing in IT projects often leads to a number of serious problems: increased lead times, budget overruns and reduced quality of the final product. In addition, the mismatch between testing processes and overall project goals can cause dissatisfaction among stakeholders. As Copeland (2004) points out, testing should not just be a quality check, but a strategic element that supports project management.

This paper aims to investigate how optimising testing processes can improve project management. In particular, the integration of testing into agile methodologies, process automation and defect lifecycle management are discussed.

#### Aims and Objectives
1. To investigate the main testing methodologies and their practical application;
2. Analyse the main problems arising in the testing process and propose solutions to eliminate them;
3. To consider the role of test automation in increasing the efficiency of projects.

## 3. Discussion üí¨

### 3.1 What is testing?

**Software testing** is the process of evaluating the degree of correspondence between the actual and anticipated outcomes of software behaviour, as determined through the analysis of a defined set of tests selected according to a specific methodology.

**The objective of testing** is to ascertain whether the software in question meets the requisite specifications, thereby instilling confidence in its overall quality. Additionally, testing serves to identify any evident errors in the software, which, if left unchecked, could potentially be discovered by the software's end users.

What is the objective of software testing?
1. The objective is to ascertain whether the software in question complies with the stipulated requirements.
2. To facilitate the identification of issues at an earlier stage of the development process, thereby preventing an increase in product costs.
3. Furthermore, the process of software testing allows for the discovery of use cases that were not foreseen during the development stage. Furthermore, the product should be evaluated from the user's perspective.
4. It is also important to increase customer loyalty to the company and the product, as any defect discovered will have a negative impact on user confidence.

### 3.2 Basic Principles of Testing

Effective testing is based on a number of fundamental principles that guide the processes of test design, execution, and evaluation. These principles help to ensure software quality, reduce costs and minimise risks. The main ones are discussed below:

1. **Testing demonstrates the presence of defects, but not their absence**
As Myers et al. (2011) point out, the main purpose of testing is to detect bugs. However, successful completion of testing does not guarantee their complete absence. This emphasises the need to combine testing with other quality assurance techniques, including code review and design reviews.

2. **Non-exhaustive testing**
It is impossible to test all possible combinations of data, use cases and conditions in most projects. According to Copeland (2004), testing should be strategically oriented and focused on the most important aspects of the system, such as critical functions and high-risk areas.

3. **Early testing**
According to Bernstein (2006), the earlier testing is incorporated into the development life cycle, the cheaper and more effective it is. Using approaches such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and continuous testing helps to detect defects during the design and development phase.

4. **Principle of defect clusters**
Hutcheson (2003) emphasises that most of the defects are concentrated in a relatively small part of the system. This allows testing efforts to be concentrated on these components using approaches such as risk analysis and focused testing.

5. **The pesticide paradox**
As noted by Dustin et al. (1999), regularly running the same set of tests over time becomes less effective at detecting new defects. To prevent this, it is important to continually update and adapt test suites.

6. **Contextuality of testing**
The effectiveness of testing methodologies depends on the type of project, its scope and characteristics. For example, for security systems, stress and fault tolerance testing is critical, while for web applications, functional and load testing will be prioritised (Lee et al., 2012).

7. **Misconception about the absence of bugs**
Successful completion of testing and absence of identified defects does not guarantee the success of a project if the product development does not meet user expectations. This emphasises the need to closely link testing to requirements management and end-user experience (Burnstein, 2006).

These testing principles form the basis for integrating the testing process into the overall project management strategy ‚Äì and it's a great idea! For example: 
1. The principle of early testing is a perfect fit for Agile and CI/CD approaches, providing quick feedback and reducing the cost of fixing defects ‚Äì a win-win! 
2. The principle of defect clusters helps optimise resources by focusing them on the most vulnerable components of the system, which is great for keeping costs down while ensuring quality. 
3. The pesticide paradox requires teams to be flexible and continually refine their testing strategies, which is a challenge that many teams relish.

These principles provide not only practical guidance for testing, but also help project managers manage the quality assurance process more effectively, which is a great bonus.

### 3.3  QA and QC Processes

Within software testing, two approaches play a key role: Quality Assurance (QA) - quality assurance and Quality Control (QC) - quality control. These concepts are related but fulfil different functions in the quality management process, which is emphasised in the studies of Burnstein (2006) and Hutcheson (2003).

**Quality Control (QC) - Quality assurance**

Product Quality Control is aimed at analysing and verifying the quality of the finished software. QC is used to evaluate the readiness of the product for release and its compliance with the specified requirements. It is the final stage of testing in which the stability, functionality and performance of the product are verified.
The main tasks of QC include:
1. Verifying that the product is ready for release (Hutcheson, 2003).
2. Verifying that the functionality meets the design requirements (Burnstein, 2006).
3. Analysing the quality of new software versions based on test results (Myers et al., 2011).

QC is a reactive approach aimed at identifying defects and correcting them once they are detected.

**Quality Assurance (QA) - Quality Assurance**

Quality Assurance is a more strategic approach focused on preventing defects by optimising development processes and implementing effective team communication. QA is seen as a process of planning and improving the entire product development and testing is only one part of it (Copeland, 2004).
The main tasks of QA include:
1. Verification of software requirements and specifications (Burnstein, 2006).
2. Assessing risks associated with development (Hutcheson, 2003).
3. Planning and implementing improvements to development processes (Dustin et al., 1999).
4. Preparing documentation, test environment and test data (Copeland, 2004).
5. Conducting testing and analysing the results (Aniche, 2022).

QA is a proactive process that focuses on preventing bugs by improving the efficiency of all development processes.

**Verification and Validation**
The QA and QC processes are closely related to the concepts of verification and validation, which are often confused. However, their differences are important to understand:

1. **Verification** is the verification of whether a product meets the technical requirements and conditions specified during the design phase (Myers et al., 2011).
2. **Validation** is to check whether a product fulfils the expectations of end users (Burnstein, 2006).

**Example to illustrate:**
*During the development of the flap control system for the Airbus A310, the challenge was to put the flaps into braking mode when the landing gear touched the ground. Initially, the system was activated when the landing gear rotated, which was considered correct from a verification point of view. However, testing in wet runway conditions revealed that the flaps did not open in time because the landing gear did not start to rotate. From a validation point of view, the product did not fulfil the real requirements. The solution was to use tyre pressure measurement to activate the flaps, which satisfied both approaches.*

Proper separation of QA and QC processes allows testing to be effectively integrated into the overall project management strategy. As Dustin et al. (1999) point out, QA provides systematic improvement of development, while QC provides verification of the finished product. This confirms the importance of both concepts for creating quality and reliable software.

### 3.4 Testing Methodologies: Analysis and Comparison

There are so many different approaches to software testing! They vary depending on project goals, technologies used, and constraints, which makes them all so interesting. For example, you'll find a detailed description of black box, white box, and combined approaches methodologies in Copeland and Bernstein's work. These approaches are seen as absolutely critical to the success of the project!

Copeland (2004) makes an excellent point: using a black box approach is perfect for users who aren't familiar with the ins and outs of the application. However, it does have one drawback ‚Äî it often misses bugs related to the logic of the code. On the other hand, Bernstein (2006) makes an excellent point: white box testing can be limited by technical complexity and require considerable effort for complete coverage. Hybrid methodologies offer the exciting opportunity to achieve a balance where bugs can be detected both in the development phase and in user testing.

Let's dive into the exciting world of Agile and CI/CD methodologies! These methodologies often require the use of automated testing, as noted by Dustin et al. (1999). This is why it's so important to be able to quickly identify defects and ensure continuous integration. The authors really emphasise the importance of early test planning, which is in line with the study by Lee and Kang (2012) who note the positive impact of such approaches on product quality.

|:------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| Black box         | Simplicity, suitable for large systems       | Skip errors at the logic level                       |
| White box         | High accuracy, code verification             | Complexity, requires knowledge of internal structure |
| Hybrid approach   | Balance between depth and breadth of testing | Requires more resources                              |


### 3.5 Bugs: Definition, Life Cycle, and Fixes
**A bug** is a deviation of an actual result from the expected result. Bugs are an integral part of the software development process. Their understanding, correct classification and correction play a key role in ensuring the quality of the final product. Bugs can manifest themselves in various forms including code errors, logical inconsistencies, performance issues, or failure to meet user requirements (Myers et al., 2011).
Examples of bugs are:
1. Errors in the interface resulting in incorrect display of data.
2. Algorithm malfunctioning due to a logical error in the code.
3. Loss of performance as the load increases.

**Bug lifecycle**
The bug lifecycle describes the process of managing a defect from the moment of its detection to its complete elimination. The main stages of this cycle are:

| Stage                   | Description                                                                 |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Detection**         | The bug is fixed and documented by testers. A record is created in a bug management system (e.g. Jira, Bugzilla) with details: reproduction steps, expected and actual behaviour.|
| **Assignment**          | The defect is passed to the responsible developer or team for analysis and correction. |
| **Analysis**              | Developers diagnose the problem, determining its cause and scope. Possible fixes are also evaluated at this stage.|
| **Fixing**         | Developers make changes to the code or configuration to fix the defect.|
| **Testing the fix** | Testers test whether the bug has been fixed and whether the fix has resulted in new defects (Hutcheson, 2003).|
| **Closure**            |If a bug is not reproducible, it is marked as fixed and closed.|

**Bug fixing techniques**
Bug fixing technologies depend on the development methodology adopted by the project.

1. **Waterfall model**: Bug fixing within the waterfall model is done strictly within specific development phases. For example, most bugs are fixed during the testing phases before moving to deployment. This minimises post-release issues but can increase development cycle time. As Basili and Selby (1987) point out, this approach is effective for projects with fixed requirements and limited budgets.

2. **Agile and Scrum**: In Agile methodologies, bug fixing is integrated into iterations (sprints). Testing is done in parallel with development, allowing defects to be identified earlier. According to Dustin et al (1999), the use of CI/CD within Agile facilitates automated testing and rapid bug fixing.

3. **DevOps and CI/CD**: DevOps approaches involve continuous testing and release. Automation tools, such as Jenkins or GitLab CI, enable rapid bug detection and fixing with every code change (Burnstein, 2006).

4. **Kanban**: Kanban emphasises current tasks, allowing teams to quickly switch to fixing critical bugs without waiting for other milestones to be completed.

Despite the availability of technology, fixing bugs involves a number of challenges:
1. **Regression**: fixing one bug can lead to new ones.
2. **Lack of detail in description**: poor documentation prevents reproduction of the problem and increases the time to fix.
3. **Prioritisation**: determining which bugs to fix first can be difficult with limited resources (Lee et al., 2019).

Bugs are a natural part of the development process, but managing and fixing them properly is critical to project success. The use of modern approaches such as CI/CD and Agile can reduce the time to fix bugs and improve the quality of the released product. As Burnstein (2006) and Hutcheson (2003) point out, the key to success is not only fixing bugs, but also implementing processes that minimise their occurrence.

### 3.6 Practical Application and Impact on Project Management

The manner in which the testing process is organised has a direct impact on project management. As Hutcheson (2003) posits, the implementation of automated systems such as Jira or Bugzilla can facilitate the optimisation of defect lifecycle management, thereby reducing the potential for human error. Furthermore, the utilisation of agile methodologies, such as Kanban, enables teams to concentrate on rectifying specific defects in real time. 

An illustration of this approach can be observed in the analysis of practices presented in Chin's (2020) study. The author illustrates how the standardisation of testing in accordance with ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 enhances performance by unifying processes, which is of particular significance for large organisations.

1. **Integration of testing in Agile and Scrum**
    In modern development methodologies, such as Agile, testing is performed at all stages of development, which allows to identify defects and eliminate them in a timely manner. In Scrum methodology, development is divided into short iterations (sprints), and testing is an integral part of each sprint. During each sprint, a small piece of functionality is created and then immediately tested.
    **Impact on project management**:
    1. Accelerated problem resolution: Testing during each sprint allows you to quickly identify bugs and resolve them, which significantly reduces risks in later stages of development.
    2. Flexibility in project management: The flexibility of the Agile methodology allows project managers to easily adapt the project to changing requirements. Real-time testing helps to make changes to the product quickly without significant time delays.
    3. Increased stakeholder satisfaction: During each sprint, stakeholders get access to partial versions of the product, which encourages greater involvement in the process and improves understanding between the team and the customer (Dustin et al., 1999).
2. **Test automation to increase efficiency**
In modern projects, especially with high development rates and large code volumes, test automation becomes an integral part of the process. With tools such as Selenium, Jenkins, Cypress and others, it is possible to automate tests to verify application functionality, performance and security.
**Impact on project management**:
   1. Cost and time reduction: The initial cost of setting up automation can be significant, but over time, automation saves money and time as repetitive tests can be run without human involvement.
   2. Accelerate product releases: Automation speeds up the testing process by allowing tests to be run whenever code changes, which is especially important for project teams using CI/CD (continuous integration and delivery) practices. This reduces time to fix defects and enables faster delivery of updates to the customer.
   3. Resource Optimisation: Automated testing reduces the load on the testing team, freeing up time for more complex tasks and critical defect analysis (Burnstein, 2006).
3. **Risk-based testing to prioritise critical areas**
The risk-based testing method allows testers to focus on the most critical and vulnerable parts of the programme that may have the greatest impact on end users or the business. This approach is particularly important under time and resource constraints, where it is necessary to prioritise areas for thorough testing.
**Impact on project management**:
    1. Efficient resource allocation: Focusing on the riskiest parts of the system allows testers and developers to allocate their resources efficiently, minimising the cost of testing less important elements.
    2. Reduced time to fix defects: By identifying critical defects in important areas of the project early, the time required to fix problems can be significantly reduced, improving the accuracy of scheduling.
    3. Improved product quality: This approach increases the likelihood that the most important features of the application will be tested properly, reducing the likelihood of failures in the production version (Basili & Selby, 1987).
4. **Continuous Testing and Continuous Integration (CI)**
Continuous Testing is integrated into the CI/CD process to automate tests for every change in the code and get immediate feedback. This helps the team quickly identify defects and fix them before they hit production.
**Impact on project management**:
    1. Early detection of problems: Continuous testing allows you to quickly detect bugs and defects in the code without waiting for individual phases of development to be completed. This reduces the likelihood of serious problems appearing in the final version of the product.
    2. Rapid adaptation: CI allows you to integrate code changes in real time, which reduces conflicts and increases the speed of development. It also contributes to project agility, as testing can be adapted to any changes.
    3. Process optimisation: Continuous testing and integration makes the development process more stable and predictable, which increases stakeholder confidence and avoids unexpected delays in the latter stages of development (Myers et al., 2011).
5. **Test-Driven Development (TDD) to improve code quality**
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an approach to software development in which tests are written before the code is written. The developer first determines what functionality should be implemented, then writes a test that verifies that functionality, and only then implements the code itself.
**Impact on project management**:
    1. Reduced time to fix defects: Because each piece of code is tested before it is written, the likelihood of defects occurring during the development process is reduced. This reduces the number of patches and increases the stability of the software product.
    2. Increased team productivity: Developers working with TDD methodology write higher quality code, which reduces the need for debugging and increases productivity throughout the project.
    3. Risk Management: The TDD methodology helps reduce risk because every change is checked for compliance with requirements and functionality from the beginning, eliminating the accumulation of bugs during the development process.
    4. Code maintainability: The use of TDD promotes writing code that is easier to maintain and modify as tests are always present and help to track the correctness of changes (Myers et al., 2011).

Effective testing practices have a significant impact on project success, helping project managers minimise risks, optimise resource utilisation and improve the quality of the final product. Adopting testing practices such as integrating testing into Agile, automating processes, risk-based testing and using TDD helps improve team efficiency and accelerate development. 

### 3.7 Threats and Their Prevention
Software testing, although an integral part of product quality assurance, involves a number of threats and risks. If these risks are not managed properly, they can significantly affect the timing, cost, and success of the project. Understanding these threats and implementing preventive measures is essential for effective quality assurance.

The principal risks inherent to the testing process include:

1. Insufficient detail in test cases may result in the omission of significant bugs. As observed by Myers et al. (2011), this issue can be resolved by the implementation of high-level acceptance criteria.
2. A lack of synchronisation between teams is a common issue in complex projects. Basili and Selby (1987) highlight the significance of employing metrics to assess the efficacy of testing procedures.

**Common Testing Threats and Their Prevention Strategies**

| **Threat**                                  | **Description**                                                                 | **Prevention Strategy**                                                                                                                                                          |
|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inadequate Test Coverage**                | Lack of testing critical features or edge cases, leaving defects undetected.     | - Comprehensive test planning to cover all functionalities. <br> - Use code coverage tools (e.g., JaCoCo, Clover). <br> - Risk-based testing focusing on high-risk areas.         |
| **Misconfigured Test Environment**         | Differences between the test and production environment causing inconsistent results. | - Automated environment setup using tools like Docker and Vagrant. <br> - Environment management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef). <br> - Regular monitoring of test environment configurations. |
| **Unclear or Changing Requirements**       | Lack of stable or clear requirements leading to incomplete or inaccurate tests.  | - Clear communication with stakeholders for precise requirements. <br> - Traceability matrices to map requirements to test cases. <br> - Use Test-Driven Development (TDD).  |
| **Human Error and Inconsistent Testing**    | Mistakes in executing tests or missed steps leading to incorrect test results.  | - Implement automated testing for repetitive test cases (e.g., Selenium, Cypress). <br> - Thorough test case documentation and peer review. <br> - Regular training for testers.   |
| **Regression Issues Due to Continuous Changes** | New changes breaking previously working functionality.                          | - Automated regression testing using CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI). <br> - Frequent integration of code to catch issues early. <br> - Maintain stable release branches.   |
| **Performance Issues and Load Testing Gaps**| The system may not handle high load or performance bottlenecks.                 | - Regular load and stress testing with tools like JMeter and Gatling. <br> - Test the system under peak load conditions. <br> - Perform scalability testing to ensure growth.    |
| **Security Vulnerabilities**                | Failure to detect potential security flaws or breaches.                         | - Integrate security testing (e.g., static code analysis with Checkmarx, SonarQube). <br> - Conduct penetration testing (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite). <br> - Secure coding practices. |
| **Ineffective Test Data Management**        | Poor-quality or incomplete test data leading to unreliable test results.        | - Use test data management tools (e.g., Delphix, IBM Optim) for data masking and compliance. <br> - Generate realistic and varied test datasets. <br> - Anonymize sensitive data.   |

The management of threats within the testing process is of paramount importance to the maintenance of software quality and the success of the project. The prompt identification of risks and the implementation of appropriate prevention measures, such as the automation of regression tests, the utilisation of secure development practices and the employment of performance testing tools, enables the avoidance of common issues and the enhancement of testing efficiency.

### 3.8 Use of Automation in Testing

Test automation plays a key role in the modern software development process. It ensures high speed of test execution, reduces costs and improves the quality of released products. With automation, you can cover multiple scenarios, reduce human errors and integrate testing into continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) cycles.

There are so many amazing benefits to test automation. One of the best things about it is how quickly it can be done. Automated tests are much faster than manual tests, especially when you're repeating the same type of scenarios. This is especially important for large projects where frequent regression testing is required.

**Stages of automation implementation**
1. **Definition of objectives**: Selection of processes that are most beneficial to automate (regression testing, load testing, security tests).
2. **Selection of tools**: Selection of tools that match the project needs and the technical stack.
3. **Creation of test scripts**: Developing scripts based on test cases that should be clear and reproducible.
4. **Monitoring and support**:Regularly analysing and updating automated tests to prevent them from becoming obsolete.

**Modern automation tools**
Test automation today is represented by a wide range of tools, each of which has its own peculiarities. Below we consider the most popular of them and compare them.

**Comparative analysis**
1. Selenium is the standard for web testing due to its versatility and support for multiple programming languages. However, setting it up can require considerable effort, especially for beginners.
2. Cypress, on the other hand, is more web-friendly, offering a simple interface and powerful debugging tools, but is limited in browser support (only Chromium and Firefox).
3. Appium stands out in mobile testing, providing the ability to work with both native and hybrid applications, but requires significant resources for infrastructure deployment.
4. TestComplete and JMeter show strengths in visual and load testing respectively, but their use can be difficult due to cost or functionality limitations.

Modern automation tools empower software teams to enhance productivity, detect bugs faster, and streamline CI/CD workflows. A combination of these tools, chosen based on project requirements, can optimize testing efforts and improve overall product quality. 

## 4. Conclusions üèÅ
The paper delved into the essential building blocks of the testing process and their impact on IT project management. I'm thrilled to share the main takeaways from this study:

Effective testing is all about having a coherent structure that aligns with the project development methodology, whether Agile, Waterfall, or Hybrid.
Integrating testing into the overall project management strategy is a great way to avoid issues such as delays in defect detection or a lack of coordination between teams.

Using sophisticated test design methodologies and process automation, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), is a fantastic way to speed up and simplify the testing process, which in turn enhances the final quality of the product.

Organising the testing process is absolutely essential for a successful software development journey! It has a direct impact on product quality, implementation time and stakeholder satisfaction ‚Äì so it's really important and a great opportunity to make a difference! 

The great news is that these issues can be easily solved through strategic test planning! By implementing a more consistent approach across teams, reducing delays in defect detection and automating processes, we can achieve a more efficient and effective testing process. The fantastic news is that there are ways to minimise errors and speed up the release of a quality product. These include using hybrid methodologies, automated bug management systems and sound test design techniques.
