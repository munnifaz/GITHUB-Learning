### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Project Title : SCM Task 1.2
 
Description : I have forked, cloned the repository and created a pull request.
Next practical was to use .gitignore and readmefile. 

contributors : Sunaina Sharma. 

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull 
Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the 
original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.
