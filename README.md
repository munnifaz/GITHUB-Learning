Welcome to the Spoon-Knife repository! This project serves as an excellent example for learning how to fork a repository on GitHub. 

## 🚀 What is Forking?

Forking is the process of creating a personal copy of someone else's project. It's a fundamental concept in social coding on GitHub and serves several purposes:

- It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
- It enables you to propose changes to someone else's project via Pull Requests.
- It can be used as a starting point for your own project ideas.
